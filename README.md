# EigenLaueDiffraction_Working

A working directory for an xray diffraction simulation for periodic crystaline structures, ranging from simple minerals such as table salt to biological structures such as DNA. Originally created to produce [Laue Diffraction Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laue_equations), the framework provided here aims to to simulate single crystal (or near single) diffraction for any crystaline structure. The project takes a quantum mechanical based approach to calculating the far (and less precicely, near) field diffraction patterns for vairous materials. Currently, the simulation is suited for crystals <100 units in size (or roughly <5000 atoms) at a resolution scale down to ~1nm at the imaging plane.

## Objectives and Motivation behind the project
Typical approaches to opical-path tracing employ a fourier-optics approach to solve the wave equation via approximation to first order and using a fourier series to simulate "propogation" of the wave over some distance. 

This approach has three glaring flaws that are often overlooked in favour of simplicity of calculations: 
1) A complete loss of phase information at the point of direct measurement (plotting the intensity). This leads to the eponymously dubbed "phase problem" frequently dealt with in modern day crystolography.
2) The implicit "squashing" of the third spacial directions when approximating the radiating stucture as a 2-Dimensional Appeture through which the diffraction occurs. 
3) An abandonment of quantum phenomena in favor of a geometric interpretation of scattering within a crystal, which leads to a loss of information in quantum correction effects

By employing a physics-based framework for the simulation, these flaws are handeled within the calculations and the only approximation needed is handled by the user at run time (via terminating the partial wave analysis summation at an early index)

## Current Status and Immediate Goals

Currently, the program is capable of reporducing experimentally backed results for simple mineral lattices (crystaline materials falling into one of the 6 families of Bravais latticies), as well as special user-defined "unique" crystals that require a bit more finese in modeling (such as B-form DNA).

Some main goals of the project that are yet to be handeled fully, but are vital to expanding the usefulness of the simulation: 
1) **Speed up the process of light propogation** (This project was created with this roadbloack eternally in mind). This can be achieved in a few ways, the most promising is to employ a combination of quantum mechanic based scale factors (to account for physical corrections that will lead to the shifting/broadening of diffraction lines), while using FFT for the bulk of the transform from the diffraction to imaging planes.
This will need to be done in "layers" in planes parallel the projection screen to preserve 3-Dimensional information in the diffraction pattern. Propogation of the light can be handeled via FFT, however overall intensity scales will be set by calculations gathered via QFT, bridging the two methods. Employing Bluestein's Method can allow for a "zoom" feature that will be beneficial for XRD applications. This will allow for special calculations for "zones of interest" for a closer study into the simulation's performance for certain crystaline structures. [For example, the "missing 4th layer" in Franklin's Photo 51 of B-Form DNA](https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0365110X53001939) should be able to be studied in detail. [See this paper published in nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-020-00362-z) for more inspiration behind this thought.
3) Investigation of more "exoctic" dynamic diffraction effects, such as the [pendell√∂sung effect](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-16-12-9097&id=163314). The perfect periodicity of the simulated crstals is actually quite detrimental in real experiments as it leads to relatively strong secondary effects. Usually, imperfect sections in a crystal average these effects towards the median of the diffraction intensity, however this simulation provides a perfect sandbox to study such effects
4) Addition of crystal impurities, to simulate more accurate real world senarios. These do not need to be large, just an extra addition of a Cystal::cellStructure tacked onto an existing structure. Real world extinction lengths limit these effects heavily in effective distance; running these tests on the current iteration of the simulation could be done before propogation optimization.


Some Preliminary plots are shown below. The orignial "goal" of the project was to accurately reproduce Laue Spots. These spots occur at precise angles and locations for a given crystal within a stereographic projection. By "growing" the crystal and using simulated band-pass filters and other neat tricks allowed by the convolution thereom we can isolate these peak determine their location. This gives us a way to calibrate the simulation to real world experiments. 

Shown below is an average output for two different crystals (olivine and sodium) of the simulation and the effects proper filtering has on the pattern. The broad regions of intenisty represent a set of "solutions" to the wave equation rather than precise values determined by crystal geometry. These extra solutions are usually filtered out via large amounts of repetition in a real world crystal on the scale of ~10 microns (or thought of another way, higher sampling frequency in the cyrstal space leads to more precise measurements in diffraction space). However, our simulated crystals of ~10 units across are at a scale of about ~10-100 Angstroms, thus leading to a broadening of the peaks.

After image processing and filtering the **heavily** broadened diffraction lines, pattern recognition is ran on a binary-thresholded representation of the diffraction pattern, and the pixel location of the simulated Laue Spots can be translated into real-space coordinates. These calculations can then be compared with experiment, as well as used as a nice self-check to make sure the geometry of the simulated crystal is accurately telegraphed by the Laue Pattern. Shown below is an example of a N<sub>x,y,z</sub> = 6 (total of 6<sup>3</sup> = 216 unit cells) crystal of Salt, desribed by its primative orientation, and the red circles are a result of OpenCV's blob detection reature tuned for a while circle on a dark background. The crystal is being beamed along its [001] axis as described by Miller indecies.

Overlaying the locations of the detected Laue spots (red circles) onto the direct observation at the projection screen within the simulation, we see nice agreement. The underyling structure revealed within the illumnated laue spots is merely an effect of aliasing due to improper sampling at run time. The sensitivity to thresholding provides a good analouge to the variable of time in real world experiments -- a single simulation run for a single orientation of a crystal can take ~10 seconds, real world experiments take on the order of days depending on the equipment. Increased false-positive rates increase with radial distance, this is adjustable via proper treshholding and is analogous to pre-maturely removing a photographic plate during the experiement.

## More complicated crystaline structure

To be a crystal in a physical sense speaks only to the structure of an object defined by its highly predicably and periodic nature. In this sense, anything mathching this periodic condition can be treated (albeit with a bit more tact) as a crystal. This has been used heavily in the fields of chemsitry and biology, where XRD and Crystalography data are crutial to understanding chemical structure and function. Early pioners of this thinking included Rosalind Franklin, who produced the now famous Photo 51, characterizing the double-helix shape of DNA using nothing but the principles explored earlier in this project. Thus, recreation of her results should be possible within the framework of the simulation. 

Realistically, there are some effects that appear within the simulation that make an exact 1:1 comparison with experimental results difficult, however proper data analysis can ease the discrepencies. The most glaring difficulty presented currently is the inability to scale the crystal to arbitrary sizes without sacrificing enormous emounts of time. This leads to difficulty in modeling the "congregate effect" of large-crystal systems; that is to say the physical edges of our simulated crystal impede on the "idealized" diffraction pattern that would be created in aggregate. To illustrate this point, we examine the simulated diffraction pattern of B-Form DNA, the form of DNA we all likely think of in our minds.

Below is the diffraction pattern of B-DNA Modeled using N = 60 Points, split among two posphate backbones as well as some inner structure meant to represent the nucleobases bridging the helicies. The single DNA crystal is oriented vertically and rotated from from its original position by 220&deg; around the verticle axis. An important feature to note is the asymmetry presented by splitting the pattern down the line X = 0. This asymmetry is a direct effect of the 3-Dimmensional nature of the DNA structure, and a representation on how one of the helicies must "cross over" the other, leading to an asymetric diffraction pattern. Representing the helix as a 2D projection of sine waves and propogating the wave via FFT looses some of this information. Second, It is important to realize the radius of the feint circle encompasing the pattern is a **direct** consequence of the modeled DNA height as can be calculated via conventional optics formuae.

Franklin's experiment did not measure one single DNA twist, she instead was beaming highly-hydrated fibres of DNA hung vertically, and bunched together in spools of micron scale. The result of her experiment then more accurately reflects, again, the congregate diffraction of many strands of DNA oriented randomly due to the hydration breaking the DNA from its crystaline form. We can simulate diffraction over many units of DNA each positioned randomly at various orientations, however this leads to time being a limiting factor. We unfortunately cannot employ the same filtering techniques as with simpler crystals, as the diffraction structure is more dyanmic in shape. However, by recognizing Franklins experiment is agnostic to DNA's rotation relative to the screen, we can instead use a spacial average to help aleviate some of crsytal-edge effects. By running the simulation over 36 equally spaced rotations of the crystal along the major axis of the DNA and averaging the results (and filtering out noise caused from the simulation), we can obtain a diffraction image presented below, as well as a thresholded image with the colors inversed to accurately match real world photographic plate's "negative is positive" appearance.

The simulated crystal shows heavy banding immediately in the viscinity of the axis of the beam, wehere as Franklin's experiments show this banding being suppressed as the DNA fiber spools get thicker and more hydrated. We can interpret this as the crystal remaining "stuck" along the major axis, as we have only averaged over rotation about this axis of the DNA. This crystaline structure close to the beam axis is similar in theory to Franklin's A-form (dry) DNA photgraphs, however the geometry of A and B form DNA is quite different, so a direct comparison cannot easily be made. Some structures, such as the 34&deg; tilt to the "X" structure within the diffraction pattern (corresponding to the fractional pitch per base pair of the DNA strand), as well as the increasingly spaced and feint banding structure radiating from the center of the pattern. At this resolution and scale, the missing 4th band cannot clearly be made out via threshholding, however there is a decrease of intensity at a radius corresponding to the 4th band. 

We can assume further that hyrdation to fiberous DNA does not only rotationally average the diffraction pattern along its major axis, but minor axis as well. A true diffraction image, such as Franklin's,  would be averaging the diffration pattern over thousands of DNA units at random orientations, thus a true simulation would require full integration over all possible orientations of the crystal. However due to time limitations of the simulations, we instead only average here over rotations about the X,Y, and Z axis with the understanding more averaging leads to more representative results.


## An interesting aside (connection to Julia Sets, Newton's Method)

As an interesting aside, we can turn our attention quickly to the concept of Newton's Method. When solving for the roots of a polynomial, one can employ Newton's Method which is method of updating one's initial (possibly random) guess based on the properties of the function being studied at the point of the guess. Specifically, with Newton's Method, one takes the ratio of the function at that point, with the __derivative__ of the function at that point in conjuction with the guess itself to return a new guess. This process can be repeated over and over again, at each step taking a new ratio, adding it the the orignal guess, and repeating to infinity in order to find the roots of the given function. 

Glossing over some of the complexities of this (what if it cant find a root before the function blows up to infinity? what if we get caught in a cycle?), whe can imagine a senario where one does this for **every point** on the complex plane. First, you take the initial coordinates, then you repeatively iterate on that guess given the predefined method, and at the end you see which of the roots the point ended closest to. . We color these points red, blue or green depending on where they end up. Then, we can reverse the method after the coloring and return each point to its original location. The result of such a procedure produces plots such as the example to the right pulled from wikiepdia. 
 
 <img align="right" width="400" height="400" src="https://github.com/michaelLukasik/EigenLaueDiffraction_Working/assets/138163589/b2cfca84-9d3e-4908-9e29-856b2f2de183">

Notice, for most points, it is obvious which "region" they will belong too given the initial location; for these points the iterative method quickly "captures" the points into the roots' gravity. However, there exist these boundary zones (and zones within those zones, and within those zones, and...) where it is not quickly obvious that a point should belong to a specific region. And what about the points between these zones? There must be infinitely many points along the boundary itself (formally, the Julia Set of points) that don't "belong" to any one region. Infact, it can be shown that for such a diagram, you cannot draw a circle that only contains two, and only two, of the three colors present.

Now, instead, consider we create a function such that it evolves itself into the future given **ONLY** its current state as an input with no hidden variables that do not appear in measurement. If we specify the functions initial condition, and give it instructions on how to evolve itself, we should be able to play a similar game as before, however we lose the ability to color the final state as we cannot encode the "source root" into our function given it only takes its state as an input. What would be the output of such a "color-blind" Newton's Method? Well, we already have seen the answer, as diffraction is exactly this result with the wave equation playing the part of the self-evolving function. 

To illustrate this point, compare the two outputs shown below. The left image is the diffraction image for a small bundle of DNA angularly averaged over its major axis, and the image on the right is the Newton Method domain-shaded output given the equation $sin\(z) = 1$. Despite the $\{pi}/2$ rotation due to the diffraction, the patterns are strikingly similar. What we see is that the areas of constructive interference in the diffraction image correspond to the areas associated with the Julia Set on the Newton Method image! This should not be terribly supprising however if we consider the differences between the integer-binary-rigid arithmatic operations associated with prescribing one point with one (and only one) source, and our float-based quantum-dictated world.

The areas just to either edge of the Julia set desrcribe an area of instability between the influence of the roots. If one were to nudge the state in any small direction, the associated change of state could be massive when we are discussing points in this region. This highly chaotic behavior leads to the beautiful and never ending fractal patterns, but are smoothed over via quantum mechanics. In particular, the domain-shading procedure of Newton's Method describes a diffraction pattern in a world where instead of averaging via the rules of superposition, we instead take the maximum contribution at that location in space, and discard the rest of the contributions. 

Points that lie directly on the Julia set correspond to an "equal" contribution from each of the roots, this corresponds to areas of constructive interference in the diffraction picture. In this way, we can study the structure of fractal patterns (and in specific, the structure of Julia sets) to give a rough estimate on the diffraction pattern of a certain structure. 

A full investigation into this might be carried out in the future, however in order to do this some adjustments need to be made. In specific, this problem is SCREAMING quaternions from two different directions now: the stereopgraphic projection (which quaternions lend a nice hand in explaining the motion of such projections under rotation), and now in complex dyanimics. Some adjustments will have to be made to the code in order to get this up and running, but there isn't much avaible information online so it may be worth the time to look into.
